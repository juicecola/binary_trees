C - Binary trees
A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

In C programming language, binary trees can be implemented using pointers. Each node in the binary tree is represented by a structure that contains a data element and two pointers, one for the left child and one for the right child.
